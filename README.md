# odin-recipes

This is an Odin project designed to reinforce my understanding of basic html.

The aim is to create a small recipe website, with a main index page linking to some recipes.

The website should have headers, paragraphs, images and links present.

Specifically, recipe web pages should have the following content:

    - An image of the finished dish under a h1 heading.

    - Under the image, an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a description of the recipe.

    - Under the description, an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients.

    - Under the ingredients list, a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps to make the dish.
