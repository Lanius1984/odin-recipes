    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy chicken alfredo pasta recipe is rich, creamy and the perfect antidote to hunger pangs.</p>
    <p>You're just a few steps away from cheesy pasta perfection.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients - Serves 2 as a Main</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive Oil</li>
        <li>4 chicken thighs, cut in half</li>
        <li>300g fettuccine</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>200ml double cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp nutmeg, ground</li>
        <li>100g parmesan</li>
        <li>10g parsley, freshly chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium high heat.<br>
            Add the chicken thighs and fry for around 10 mins, turning half way, until they are golden brown and cooked through.<br>
            Set aside to cool a little, then use two forks to shred.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and add the pasta, cook for 1 minute less that package instructions.<br>
            Whilst the pasta is cooking, add the butter to the frying pan over a medium heat, scraping the bottom a little to get any of the browned bits.<br>
            Tip in the cream along with the nutmeg and bring to a simmer.<br>
            Add the chicken back to the pan.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, use tongs to transfer the pasta straight from the water into the frying pan with the cream mixture.<br>
            Sprinkle most of the parmesan over and use the tongs to toss it all together, adding a splash of the pasta water if it looks a little stiff.<br>
            Season well, then tip into bowls. Top with the remaining parmesan, a scattering of parsley, and black pepper.</li>
