    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Saag Aloo features tender & flavorsome potatoes, sauteed with spices, spinach or your favorite greens.</p>
    <p>Make this one pot meal under 45 minutes on the stovetop or in the Instant pot with my easy recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Potatoes</strong> - I use white potatoes and do not recommend new potatoes as they can get too mushy and break down.</li>
        <li><strong>Spinach</strong> - Use young or baby greens. If you are using mature greens, trim down the stalks as they can taste bitter.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong> - I use pureed fresh tomatoes. Remember saag does not need lots of tomatoes.</li>
    </ul>
